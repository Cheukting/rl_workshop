# Step into the AI Era: Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop
In this workshop, through exercises, we will learn about (Deep) Reinforcement Learning and how to implement different strategies and train an agent to solve different tasks (or play games) in [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). For the consistency of the environment and make use of a free GPU, we will use [Google Colaboratory](http://colab.research.google.com/) (Google Account needed)

## Agent, Environment and Rewards

The 101 of Reinforcement Learning is to know about what is an agent, what is the environment and why rewards are important.
